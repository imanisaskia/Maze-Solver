# Maze Solver

## Description
A simple maze-solver which transforms an external binary map into a graph. Uses BFS and A* algorithms to find the solution route, and PyGame for visualization.

## How to Use
1. Run Program.py
2. When prompted, type in the external file path for the maze map (e.g. "small.txt" is included)
3. A PyGame window will open and render the maze map
4. Click the window to see BFS-generated route
5. Click the window again to see A*-generated route
